/* 
hey guys here you see my columns ,the array c_columns is used to create a data table to make your custom table you need first a array like c_columns  dont forget to have columndef on that . 
start :
above i created C_NAME which has its own type from global file there are two value needed for simple col head;
in case u need custom column like select, email just copy the above declaration C_EMAIL and rename it then use it on your custom array , don't forget to export your array.
for sorting your column see C_EMAIL  
donot overWRITE the above code  write your code on below to this comment and export it
